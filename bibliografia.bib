  abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer and the leading type of cancer death. Mammography is the recommended imaging modality for periodic breast cancer screening. A few datasets have been published to develop computer-aided tools for mammography analysis. However, these datasets either have a limited sample size or consist of screen-film mammography (SFM), which have been replaced by full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in clinical practices. This project introduces a large-scale full-field digital mammography dataset of 5,000 four-view exams, which are double read by experienced mammographers to provide cancer assessment and breast density following the Breast Imaging Report and Data System (BI-RADS). Breast abnormalities that require further examination are also marked by bounding rectangles.},

  abstract = {An experiment intended to evaluate the clinical application of contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to chest computer tomography (CT) images is reported. A machine especially designed to compute CLAHE in a few seconds is discussed. It is shown that CLAHE can be computed in 4 s after 5-s loading time using the specially designed parallel engine made from a few thousand dollars worth of off-the-shelf components. The processing appears to be useful for a wide range of medical images, but the limitations of observer calibration make it impossible to demonstrate such usefulness by agreement experiments.{$<>$}},
